# False attack (second intention)

A false attack is an action carried out with a second intention.

Exploratory false attacks serve to familiarise ourselves with our opponent (scandaglio) and tire them out, both physically and mentally. These false attacks are to be carried out with care, to prevent double hits caused by both fencers initiating an action in the same tempo.

Provocative false attacks exploit the habits, mistakes and reflexes of the opponent. With a provocative action we goad the opponent into a counter-attack, riposte or afterblow, which we anticipate and parry with ease, giving us an opportunity to land our intended attack (perhaps a riposte, a contra-riposte or a counter-attack).
