# Normal distance

Also called: large distance

Two fencers are at the proper distance when, in a standard fencing stance, their sabres cross at the upper third.

From this distance, staying in the fencing position, without advancing, we cannot touch the opponent.

From here, with a step forward we get to the **middle distance**.
