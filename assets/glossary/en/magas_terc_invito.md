# High tierce parry

*Note: this position is not an invito, rather a modified parry. It is only grouped together with the invitos for the glossary.*

The high tierce is a modified tierce parry, in which we can receive higher attacks given by the opponent.

It is assumed from the seconde guard, when only the outer higher openings are threatened, which are more suited to be parried with the sabre held with the 1/2 **hand position**.
