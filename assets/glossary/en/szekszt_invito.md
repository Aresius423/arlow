# Sixte parry

*Note: this position is not an invito, only a parry. It is only grouped together with the invitos for the glossary.*

The arm is bent in an obtuse angle, with the hilt in front and a bit higher than the left temple. The edge faces upwards, with the point towards the right and up, one span of the hand higher than the hilt.

It covers the head, but can only be used against cuts.
