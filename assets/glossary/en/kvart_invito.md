# Quarte invito

The quarte invito covers the inner side of the body.  
It exposes the head and the entire outer side.

The forearm, like in the **tierce guard** is horizontal, but brought in front of our left side.  
The point is in eye height, but brought a bit to the left. The edge faces to the left and forward. (3/4 **hand position**)
