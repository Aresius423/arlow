# High seconde parry

*Note: this position is not an invito, rather a modified parry. It is only grouped together with the invitos for the glossary.*

The high seconde is a modified seconde parry, in which we can receive higher attacks given by the opponent.

It covers the outer face (which the seconde guard doesn't), but covers the side less.
