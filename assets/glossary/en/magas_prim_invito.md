# High prime parry

*Note: this position is not an invito, rather a modified parry. It is only grouped together with the invitos for the glossary.*

The high prime is a modified prime parry, in which we can receive higher attacks given by the opponent.

It covers the inner face (which the prime parry doesn't), but not the belly.
