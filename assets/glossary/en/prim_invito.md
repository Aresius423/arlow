# Prime invito

The prime invito covers the inner side of our body: the inner face, the chest and the belly.  
It exposes the side, the outer face and the arm.

The hilt is brought in front of the left shoulder, the sabre points downwards, its edge facing to the left and forward (1/4 **hand position**)  
We can look over the arm, which is almost fully extended, with the elbow turned upwards.
