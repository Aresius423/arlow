# Seconde guard

The seconde guard is a primarily defensive guard.

The forearm is horizontal, the elbow is rotated so that the edge of the sabre points upwards and to the right (1 - 1/2 hand position), and the point targets the opponent's hip.

The shoulders should be relaxed, and the elbow should be bent slightly.
