# Hand positions

In the first hand position, the edge of the sabre points upwards.  
In the second hand position, the edge of the sabre points to the right.  
In the third hand position, the edge of the sabre points downwards.  
In the fourth hand position, the edge of the sabre points to the left.

The intermediary hand positions are denoted as 1/2, 2/3, etc.

From the 1st hand position, we can get to 1/4 with a quarter turn of the hand, and from the 4th hand position we get to 4/1 with a quarter turn. The orientation of the sabre is identical, but it's held differently.
