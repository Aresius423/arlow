# Guard

A position of the body and the sabre is called a guard (garde, guardia), where we are best prepared and ready for both attacking and defending. The mark of a good fencing stance / guard is that from it an attack can be carried out with ease, exposes as little of our body as possible, the sabre is held in a way that it doesn't only protect the arm but also the body parts closest to our opponent, and the point prevents a direct attack.

Two guards are used: the **tierce guard** and the **seconde guard**.
