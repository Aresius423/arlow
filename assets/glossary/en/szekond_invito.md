# Seconde invito

The seconde invito covers the side.  
It exposes the entire head and the inner side.

The arm, as in the **seconde guard** is comfortably extended, the hilt is moved a bit towards the right at armpit height. The edge faces to the right and upwards (1/2 **hand position**), the sabre points downwards, with the point past the opponent's side, by a span of the hand to the right.
