# Invito

An invito is a position of the sabre that covers certain body parts, while noticeably exposing others. It can be used to bait the opponent into attacking the exposed parts.

Invitos are proper parries, the difference being that the invito means the static position in which we are awaiting the opponent's action, while a parry is a motion in response to an already initiated cut or thrust, whose end position is the invito.
