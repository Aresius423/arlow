# Tierce guard

For a tierce guard, bend your elbows so that the point targets the opponent's right eye, the edge of the sabre points downwards and to the right (2 - 2/3 hand position), and the forearm is horizontal.

This guard is suited both for attack and defence. The hand and the outer face is protected from simple attacks, and attacks to other body parts can't easily be delivered without preparation, due to the point aimed at the eye.

As it protects both the arm and the outer face, it's advised to (for at least a moment) return into a tierce guard after an attack, or to assume the seconde guard through this position.
